In Module 02 at Tech Elevator, the main focus was on databases and how they are used.

We learned how to make tables and how they were used.  The database mangagement system that we used was PostgreSQL.  Throughtout the module, I learned how to:
 - Create tables
 - Collect data with SELECT statements
 - INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
